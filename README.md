# Hi there, I'm Haemin! 

I'm a **Scala** enthusiast and startup engineer who’s passionate about:

- **Functional Programming** (emphasizing the “reify & compose” approach)
- **Reducing Cognitive Load** (so we can all clock out at 6pm)
- **Pragmatic Architectures** (because real-world constraints trump dogma)

I’ve spent years exploring FP not just as "purity and immutability," but also as a way to manage complexity by turning tricky concepts into composable values. My code/work is grounded in this philosophy: identify the structures that creates the most cognitive load or communication friction, and systematically removing them.

## My Project

- **[Decrel (Declarative Data Access with Composable Relations)](https://github.com/yoohaemin/decrel)**  
  A library that reifies domain entity relations as typed values so we can *compose* them. Eliminates N+1 queries and keeps big systems more manageable.
- more to come...
